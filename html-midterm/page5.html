        <h2>Page 1 Errors Fixed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Added DOCTYPE and HTML to the layout (didn't have it before)</li>
            <li>Added the meta elements to the head element (didn't have it before)</li>
            <li>Swapped the h3 and h2 elements so that h2 is above h3 (h3 used to be above h2)</li>
            <li>Indented everything inside the body element (was inline with body before)</li>
            <li>Fixed the "p" end of the 6th paragraph to be "/p" as it was missing the "/" before the "p" before</li>
            <li>Fixed the "e" end of "creme fraiche" in the seventh paragraph to be "/em" as it was missing the "/" and "m" around the "e" before</li>
            <li>Fixed the title of the page from "Week 3 Assignment" to "Page 1"</li>
            <li>Fixed "margin = 0 30%" in the header's style element to "margin = 30%"</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Page 2 Errors Fixed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed the empty brackets after "New Beehive Inn" in the first paragraph to have a "/b" now</li>
            <li>Fixed all the subheaders to have the same "h2" as they were all over the place before with different "h" elements and looked messy (except "Interior" which will be an "h3" as that was a subheader of subheader "Description" in the source page)</li>
            <li>Added an "hr" under every subheader that didn't have it before as it cleaned up the design to make it look cohesive again (except "Interior" as it did not have a line under it in the source page)</li>
            <li>Fixed the first (main) header to say "New Beehive Inn" instead of "New Bradford Inn" because it was incorrect before</li>
            <li>Fixed the indentation under "New Beehive Inn" header as they were extra indented and were confusing to read</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Page 3 Errors Fixed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed "margin = 0 10%" in the header's style element to "margin = 10%"</li>
            <li>Fixed the "l" in the third list point to "li" because it was wrong before and wouldn't show a bullet point</li>
            <li>Fixed Zapata to have "td" surrounding it instead of "th"</li>
            <li>Moved "Lily" down to the next set of data entries as there were 4 entries in its old location and 2 entries in its new location before it was moved</li>
            <li>Also added "td" to the end of "Lily" as it didn't have anything before</li>
            <li>Moved "22" up to the previous set of data entries as there were 4 entries in its old location and 2 entries in its new location before it was moved</li>
            <li>Moved "Axelia" into the nest set of data entries as it wasn't in any specific data entries before</li>
            <li>Added and bolded Table Caption "Age table" to the table and added the rest of the data that was missing originally</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Page 4 Errors Fixed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Added "/td" to the end of the second given dog photo link as there was nothing before</li>
            <li>Added "td" and "/td" to surround the second given cat link as there was nothing surrounding it before</li>
            <li>Added "td" to the beginning of the second given other link as there was nothing before</li>
            <li>Change up the orders of the links so that each row doesn't have only one type of picture but rather each column has one type of picture (edit so each data entry starts with a dog link followed by a cat link followed by an other link rather than having each data entry only have dog, cat, or other links)</li>
        </ul>
